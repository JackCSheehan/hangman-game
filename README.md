A text-based hangman game written in C++. Users can pick from three different difficulties: easy, medium, or hard. Easy difficulty makes user guess shorter, simpler words with an abundant number of guesses; medium makes users guess slightly longer, more challenging words with fewer guesses; and hard mode makes users guess very long, complicated words with a more limited number of guesses.
